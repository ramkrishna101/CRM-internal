Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Multi-Tenant CRM
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a custom Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system designed for managing customer interactions across multiple websites. The system focuses on role-based access, strict data isolation, performance tracking, and efficient lead management via cold calling and daily data imports.

2. Technology Stack
Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js
Database: PostgreSQL
Infrastructure: TBD (Likely cloud-based with strict security controls)
3. User Roles & Hierarchy
The system supports a strict hierarchy where performance visibility flows upwards.

Admin: Full system access, user management, security controls.
Manager: Oversees Retention Managers and Agents. Can view total performance of their downline.
Retention Manager: Manages a team of Agents.
Agent: Front-line user. Works on one specific website at a time. Strictly isolated from other websites' data.
Service Role: Automated role for handling data imports.
Hierarchy Rules:

Agents can report to multiple Managers.
Managers see total performance of their reporting agents.
4. Core Features
4.1. Authentication & Security
Access Control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
Session Management: Strong session handling with an "Easy Revoke" feature for Admins to instantly kill sessions.
IP Whitelisting: Strict login restrictions based on IP addresses.
Multi-Tenancy: Strict data isolation at the "Website" level. Agents assigned to Website A cannot access Website B data.
4.2. Data Management
Daily Imports: Automated service fetches and imports CSV data daily.
User Mapping:
New users from CSV -> Created as New User.
Existing users -> Updated with new deposit data.
Deposit Logic:
If Total Deposit < 2 -> Categorized as One Time Deposit User.
Daily checks for new deposits to update status (e.g., Retained upon redeposit).
4.3. Cold Calling Module
Data Dump: Separate repository for "Cold" leads (distinct from active CRM users).
Claiming System:
Agents can search/view the dump.
"Click to Claim": Agents claim users to their bucket.
Limits: Max 10 claims per day per agent.
Linking: Agents can link a "Cold" lead to an existing CRM user if a match is found.
4.4. Agent Workflow
Dashboard: View assigned users and daily tasks.
Interaction Tools:
Comments: Add notes to user profiles.
Follow-ups: Create reminders for future calls.
Categorization: Dropdown to tag users (e.g., Potential, High Risk, Other).
Status Lifecycle:
New (Imported)
One Time Deposit (If deposit < 2)
Claimed (Picked by agent)
Contacted (Agent logged call/msg)
Retained (User made a redeposit)
4.5. Integrations (Placeholder)
Channels: WhatsApp, Telegram, Calling Tool.
Status: Providers TBD. Architecture must support pluggable integration modules.
4.6. Reporting & Performance
Metrics:
Number of Calls
Number of Claims
Number of Deposits
Total Value of Deposits
Conversion Ratio (Claimed vs. Converted)
Retention %
Visibility: Hierarchical view. Managers see aggregated stats for their teams.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: Handle daily imports of 1,000 - 100,000 records.
Performance: Low latency for agent dashboards and search.
Security: Audit logs for all data access and changes.
6. Future Scope
Specific integration providers (Twilio, etc.) implementation.
